# Frontend Functional Programming
__A practical guide to functional programming on the frontend using JavaScript__

## About this book
This a book about applying functional programming techniques to frontend code, mostly UI code. The code that we write usually consists of calling some APIs to get data from a server, processing that data and displaying that data. The other part is listening to user actions and maintaining the state of the UI. We will try to implement all of this using pure functions. This book won't teach you the basics of functional programming and not even the advanced stuff  such as Functors, Monads etc. I will only take this up once I have completed the parts that are the focus of this book.
